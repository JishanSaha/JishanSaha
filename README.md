# Hi there! 

## I'm Jishan Saha

I am currently pursuing Web Development because I have always had a keen interest in coding. This September, I started a web development course at Humber College. It's been a fantastic experience, and I'm enjoying the learning process. I hope to make new friends and gain references for my future endeavors in tech.

###  I’m currently learning:
- C#
- SQL and MySQL
- JavaScript
- Html
- CSS
